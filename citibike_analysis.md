# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Summary
In my Citibike analysis, I conducted a number of analyses for the New York Citibike data.
There were a number of worksheeets that I did. The first was a breakdown of the customers vs subscribers. It shows that in New York there were more subscribers than customers for the service. I also looked at the number of August Peak Hours, Total number of rides, Bike repairs, Utilization, Top and End starting locations, and looked at the breakdown for genders.

## Des Moines Story and any clarifying data.
The first page of my story simply shows my audience the breakdown of genders in New York city. The reason for this is because my question is "What is the Gender Diversity in Des Moines? "How does it compare to New York City" and "What effect does it  have on possible business in Des Moines."

In order to answer this question, it's important that I first display the gender breakdown for New York. It's easy to see that as a benchmark, much more men use the service than women.

In the second page, I clarify that Des Moines is actually 49.2% men compared to that of the 47.7% of men in New York City. This information comes from the U.S. Census Website. This is important because it will have a positive impact on the possibility of business in Des Moines.

The Third page displays the ages of New York customers depending on their age. This data is important because we get a sense of which age AND Gender are using the system. From these results, it can be concluded that people in their 20's and 30's are using it most. The median age in Des Moines is 33.9 years old. This is also positive for business in Des Moines because the average trends toward a good range for people that use the service.

The fourth page talks about the peak riding times in New York for August. It's easy to see that they are concentrated around normal business hours for local businesses. This is good because I have found that in Des Moines, there is a larger section of the population that is part of the work force and over 16+ years of age. What this means is that in terms of the ratios, a larger percentage than New York's population would be viable to use the service during peak times.

The final page talks about the peak start times in New York. It shows that most rides are starting in the city center where the population is dense. Well that is also good for business because the population area in Des Moines according to the U.S. census is smaller than that of New York City. Therefore more people would be likely to use bikes rather than cars due to close proximity.
